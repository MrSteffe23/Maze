# Maze

This was a project for the **Assembly class**. I had to build a game in assembly language.   
I chose a maze, which was **randomly generated** each time the user pressed a button. A character (like a man) have to traverse the entire maze until the end, without getting trapped in lava blocks. This little game has a **timer** and a **score board**, where you can see how many times you tried until you won.   
You can control your character with the buttons which appears on the display. Some messages will appear when you win, to congratulate you.   

The only challenge with this one was to generate a random maze each time the user was pressing a button.    
I had a great time working on this project and i am pretty proud of it.
